// Requirements:
// 3D grid
// at least one grid within 3D-grid

// Why it's necessary:
// Group headings for grid nodes within 3D-grid nodes won't show by default in Confirmit,
// and must be added manually

// For this example specifically:
// q44 (3D-grid)
// q44a (grid within q44)
// q44b (grid within q44)

//Add to 3D-grid node specific JS-script
document.getElementById("desktop_q44a_text").innerHTML = "YOUR TEXT HERE"
document.getElementById("desktop_q44b_text").innerHTML = "YOUR TEXT HERE"
